# ICSD PKCrypto Algorithms
Implementation of various Public Key Algorithms (RSA, Rabin, ElGamal) by using GNU MP library. Part of my university coursework (2013-2019, Information and Communications Systems Engineering, University of the Aegean).

GNU MP can be installed via vcpkg:

```git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git```


```.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat```

Install GNU MP:

```vcpkg install gmp```

Integration vcpkg packages with MSBuild projects:

```vcpkg integrate install```
